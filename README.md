# Nsikan Akpan Portfolio!

[Visit Live Site](https://nsikan-portfolio.netlify.app/)

This portfolio is designed to show my skills through projects. It was meant to be minimalistic yet effecitive for communicating my skills.

## This was build using

- React.js (html,javascript)
- Tailwind.css (css)

## What I like:

- Made relevant information easily accessible.

- Simple yet efficient design meant to funnel users from brief introduction into projects and finally to my contact form.

- Use of active language to get users better feel of what the outcome of their input.

- Design/Colors is not too distracting but enough to keep the site interesting.

- Made use of reusable components to make adding more projects easier in the future.

- Smooth scrolling

- Did not hide features behind any unnessessary wall.

- Made use of comments to make code easier to maintain in the future.

- Separated page based on components causing related html,css,js to be in the same area.

- Made site responsive on different devices. (Focused on mobile first.)

## To Do:

- Make email form work.

- Build more projects.

- Improve responsiveness
