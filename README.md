Welcome to my Portfolio!
I designed this portfolio to be a place where a recruiter can see my skills through projects.

This was build using
React.js (html,javascript)
Tailwind.css (css)

What I like:
I tried to be very cautious with my audiences time and made relevant information easily accessible.

Portfolio uses simple yet efficient design meant to funnel users from brief introduction into projects and finally to my contact form.

Button use active language to get users better feel of what the outcome of pressing the button is.

Design is not too distracting but enough to keep the site interesting.

Made use of reusable components to build my projects sections so I can add more projects easier in the future.

Smooth scrolling is just nice.

Limit my colors to 3 main color(pink, black, white) to have site be interest but not distracting.

Did not hide feature behind a wall.

Made use of comments to make code easier to maintain in the future.

Separated page bases on components causing related html,css,js to easy to see.

Made use of CSS-in-JS which makes changing style easy to manage.

Made site responsive on different devices. (Focused on mobile first.)

To Do:
Make email form work.

Build more projects.

Improve responsiveness
